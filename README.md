# Numerical_Analysis
This is my repository for the course "Numerical Analysis" of Zhejiang University. 

To get the report and the results, you can input these commands in the terminal in the folder of every task:
1. ```make report``` to generate the report in the ```tex``` folder.
2. ```make run``` to compile and run the code in the ```code``` folder. (It should be mentioned that the ```code``` folder exists in the theoretical assignments.)
3. ```make clean``` to clean the temporary files, including the executable file and the report file.

In addition, there is a ```README.md``` in every folder of task, so you can get more information about it.

## Chapter 1: Solving Nonlinear Equations

This chapter is mainly about the numerical methods of solving nonlinear equations. The three methods are:
1. Bisection Method
2. Newton's Method
3. Secant Method

### Theoretical Problems

The answer can be seen in the [Chapter1_Theoretical](https://github.com/Marsphw/Numerical_Analysis/tree/main/Theroretical_Problem/Chapter1). This task concentrate on the theoretical analysis in the three methods, such as the convergence, the iteration formula and the number of steps required.

### Programming Assignments

The programming assignments are in the [Chapter1_Programming](https://github.com/Marsphw/Numerical_Analysis/tree/main/Programming_Assignments/Chapter1). They focus on the implementation of the three methods in C++, with the oriented object programming style.
